# Covid-19 Museum

This is the readme of the Covid-19 Museum project

## Introduction

**Digitally connecting data collections related to the Covid-19 pandemic
to preserve their content and realize reproducible analysis of it
through open science for the common good**

 Based on the principles of open
science, open data, and reproducible research, the Covid-19 Museum
connects digital collections housing information related to SARS-CoV-2
through software installable on any resource for archiving or
calculation. The museum’s distributed architecture ensures the
protection of the information stored within the various resources and
the additional knowledge gleaned from it. As an electronic instrument
designed to further memory, pedagogy, and research, the museum will be
available to everyone.

## A pandemic in the digital era

That the novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 produced the first
pandemic of the digital era offers the unique opportunity to trace,
understand, and compare the evolution of a disease and the corresponding
societal responses—whether personal, political, medical, or
scientific—in every country. The Covid-19 Museum is itself one such
response, aimed at providing humanity with an analytical tool
commensurate to the event. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world
to a potential breaking point. By linking the multitude of issues the
novel coronavirus has exposed and created, the Covid-19 Museum, through
the research it encourages, can serve as a tool for reflection and
societal self- reflexivity. 

## Uniting the digital collections of Covid-19
artifacts

### How it works

The Covid-19 Museum does not itself house a collection on the pandemic,
but rather unites far-flung collections by providing access to them.
Each entity or individual that makes its digital information on Covid-19
publicly available for consultation and analysis within the framework of
the museum automatically becomes a member. The integration of these
collections is made possible through the installation of software
developed by the Covid-19 Museum, named the [CaMPA] and based on Harvard Dataverse. 

### Construction of the museum 

The construction of the
Covid-19 Museum revolves around the manufacture of a piece, or “brick,”
of open source code that provides the interfacing software for the
collections made available by museum members and for the computing
resources provided by institutional members and by members of the
general public who agree to make part of their computer ressources available to the Museum. 

The deployment of the code to entities and
individuals with archiving or computing capacity serves as a foundation
for the museum’s construction, and the interface established by this
installation acts as the guard and gateway to the museum.

### Role of the interface 

The Covid-19 Museum’s interface allows the
public to consult the digital artifacts on the Covid-19 pandemic in the
collection of members in accordance with the members’ own museography
and keywords. It also offers the possibility of accessing all the
available data through museum keywords by developping a meta-ontology. 

The interface establishes that
through this gateway the Covid-19 Museum is operated by the actor who
deploys the piece of code and thereby offers its resources in an act of
solidarity. 

## A museum open to researches and the general public 

The
Covid-19 Museum is a tool available to and for everyone. Anybody can
consult it, but beyond that, everyone can appropriate the tools of data
science, including artificial intelligence. 

Moreover, what distinguishes
the Covid-19 Museum from other initiatives is the possibility for
researchers to file a request for access to all or part of members’
databases to extract knowledge through the means of data science
combined with those of digital science. The museum does not analyze the
collections it connects. Rather, for the common good, it provides
researchers the capability to do so in a reproducible manner while also
protecting the knowledge extracted from it. 

Peer review remains a
separate process, conducted outside the museum. 

## Why a “museum” 

The word
museum is a Latin derivation stemming from the Greek mouseion.
Translated as “seat of the Muses,” it was a place for contemplation and
philosophical thinking, like the Alexandrian Museum, the institution
built in Egypt around 280 BCE by Ptolemy I Soter that resembles today’s
universities. Ptolemy’s creation stood as an intellectual sanctuary, a
center of research with a renowned library. Many centuries later,
Europeans adopted museum to express the concept of comprehensiveness,
not a physical structure. The Covid-19 Museum seeks, in effect, to
create an electronic version of the Alexandrian Museum that focuses on
the pandemic that is today reshaping the world.

## The Rationale behind a 'macroscope' into the museum's collection 

The retrospective of the timeline in the Now.museum (case COVID19museum) initiated from the discovery of the SARS-Cov-2 in December 2019. The data collection was primarily done from public parts (PP) of European newspapers articles in their published language with original illustrations and extended with some tweets available from public Twitter datasets, filtered out by searching keywords “covid” and “pandemic” in the title. Public metadata contains title, summary (a few first lines of text), url and date of publication, with captured screenshot of news article attached and without breaking any copyrights and affecting ownership of original publishers. All collections are stored in a Dataverse instance running at the University of Paris Cite, connected to the automatic pipeline for metadata enrichment extracting important keywords and terms appearing in the texts.

The Now.museum offers public free web access and will be available through https protocol and as an independent software on several platforms including recent Linux Ubuntu and MacOS X distributions. Our vision is to build an Artificial Intelligence infrastructure integrated with a data repository by using Semantic Web technologies. It should consist completely from Open Source components and use open Machine Learning models developed by various parties coming both from academic and industry. All data curated and published using the Dataverse data platform developed by Harvard IQSS and provided as a service that allows to keep provenance information for every single data point. Professional users such as students of Universities or scientific staff should be able to use Virtual Research Environments (VRE), notebooks such as Jupyter Notebook and other software to connect to now.museum to query and search public metadata available in our Dataverse instances.  
 
The final goal is the semantic integration of Medical, Social and Economic Knowledge Graphs to make it possible to understand not only Biological and Environmental Factors of COVID-19 spread but the Social and Economic impacts as well, and investigate how quarantine and social distancing measures affected the society. The access to all available knowledge graphs delivered by appropriate semantic services with SPARQL endpoint and exposed as Linked Data in the same way as Wikidata.
